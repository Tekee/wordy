This code is beerware: use this code however you'd like. 
If you find it useful you can buy me a beer some time. 
I'd appreciate it if you left my name in but you don't have to.

That is licensed via BSD.

While I made a few tweaks, MicroPong is by Shane Lynch:

He says it is free to reuse without restriction (except to keep
his copyright in).
