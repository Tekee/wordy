Let's get WORDY!

This code is for a MicroView based ring which uses an MMA8451 accelerometer as input.

On TAP: shows a vocabulary word. On tap or double tap, shows definition.
On DOUBLE TAP: starts Pong game, paddle position set by title of accelerometer.
On UPSIDE DOWN SHAKE: says to consider a question, waits for upside down shake (or punch) to give a response.
On PUNCH: puts up a punch word and a couple rectangles to emphasize.

As long as the wires are secure, this all works pretty well.

Note that the acclerometer must be 5V tolerant (such as the Adafruit 5V tolerant MMA8451 board).
